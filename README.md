# Katana

Katana is a lightweight, minimalistic dependency injection library (similar to the service locator pattern) for Kotlin
on the JVM, designed especially with Android in mind.

* Extremely lightweight footprint (only ~15kB in classes and ~130 methods after ProGuard), plain Kotlin, no third-party dependencies
* It's [fast](./speed-comparison) (also see this [comparison](https://github.com/Sloy/android-dependency-injection-performance))
* "Less is more", therefore:
  * No global singleton state. Likelihood of memory leaks is greatly reduced unless **YOU** are doing something wrong ;P 
  * No reflection (see [this](#a-word-on-type-erasure) regarding type erasure)
  * No code generation (unless `inline` functions count)
  * No dependency overrides possible (see [Overrides](./Getting%20Started.md#overrides))

## Artifacts

Katana consists of a core library and several additional libraries that extend
Katana's functionality. All artifact are published in group 
`org.rewedigital.katana`. Here's a quick overview of all available artifacts:
